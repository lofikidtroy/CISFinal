			<h3>Reflections</h3>
			Overall I had a very fun time in the class. It definitely opened my eyes to the capability of websites. 
			<br>
			For some reason I was under the impression that HTML/CSS couldn't do much before I progressed in this class
			<br>
			but that changed quickly. I'm quite impressed with the depth of it actually. Even more valuable than the 
			<br>
			coding skills to me though was all the minute details. Things like SEO or robots.txt were things I barely thought
			<br>
			of until this class. I had a lot of fun progressing though CIW. This final project was really fun as well. This
			<br>
			has to be one of my favorite CS classes I have taken so far.

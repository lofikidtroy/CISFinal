<h1>a little more about me...</h1>
When I'm not busy with school or work I try my best to stay active. Honestly with the pandemic going on it's been 
<br>
pretty rough trying to maintain any routine. I'm very grateful I have a group of friends who are willing to throw
<br>
a brick through my window in order to get me up (true story actually). I enjoy going to the gym with friends and 
<br>
having a nice bowl of pho. It's not the best routine ever but I make do. 
<br><br>
I love music. Most people do of course, but I really enjoy the technical aspect of it. While I chose to go for a career in CS,
<br>
one of my dream jobs would still definitely be one in audio engineering. I stick with digital audio workstations for now, but 
<br>
I'd love to get my hands on a MOOG synth or a Yamaha DX11. I'm particularly fond of the latter. It's a gorgeous piece of audio
<br>
equipment. 
<br><br>
Honestly my love for old tech doesn't even end at oldschool audio stuff. I really miss the old Palm PDAs. I had a Palm Tungsten E2
<br>
and it was awesome. Still have it. It was the iPhone before the iPhone. I like even older stuff too. My dream computer as a child 
<br>
was a Tandy TRS-80. Despite me being in Gen Z I had an odd obsession with DOS computers as a kid. Honestly I still do. 
<br><br>
2021 was an odd year. I remember people saying it could never get worse than 2020. I don't think it was much worse but I certainly
<br>
don't think it was any better either. It just felt like more of the same to me. Maybe 2022 will be that rainbow after the storm. 
<br>
I have high hopes, and wish everyone a great new year! This might be the one!
